If something isn't working as expected or you are unsure how to achieve something feel free to ask questions about how to use clarity for the Clarity Challenge. You can do so here but please also consider the [Clarity Challenge Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/clarity-challenge).

It would be useful to include the following information where applicable.

 [ ] Operating system
 [ ] Python version (`python --version`)
 [ ] clarity version (`pip show clarity`)
 [ ] Package versions (`pip freeze`)
