## AMT version 1.5 (excerpt)

Please note that the [AMT](https://www.amtoolbox.org/) toolbox scripts posted under this folder represent an extremely compact version of the official release. I (Alejandro) only extracted the required routines to get one monaural auditory model ``relanoiborra2019_featureextraction``, one of the functional models that had been reported in one of my previous studies [Osses et al. (2022, Acta Acustica)](https://acta-acustica.edpsciences.org/articles/aacus/full_html/2022/01/aacus210060/aacus210060.html).

The model ``relanoiborra2019_featureextraction`` was chosen for this VCCA demo, because it represents one of the implementations that allow to include sensorineural hearing loss as part of the cochlear filter bank module.

**Please download the most recent version of AMT from [their website](https://www.amtoolbox.org/) to take advantage of the phylosophy (and model implementations) that are included as part of the AMT toolbox.**
